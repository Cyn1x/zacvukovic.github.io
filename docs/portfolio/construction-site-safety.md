# Construction Site Safety

The Construction Site Safety Working at Heights program is reality training app was an initiative by TAFE NSW and icare that highlighted the importance of working safely at heights. The training program was delivered through an immersive virtual reality app.<br /><br />

My role for this project was mainly focused on the backend. With a growing team and no tooling around the development of immersive applications, I led a project that introduced a scalable CI/CD pipeline that automatically built, tested, and deployed Unity projects to VR headsets.<br /><br />

This application also led to advancements in our core development platform which I have also taken the initiative to help the team continue to scale after the project was completed. Using my previous infrastructure experience, I was able to expand on our user profile systems in Unity and integrate them into our enterprise cloud architecture.<br ><br >

Construction Site Safety was a [2022 Good Design Awards](https://good-design.org/projects/tafe-nsw-icare-construction-site-safety-working-heights-program/) winner.<br /><br />
