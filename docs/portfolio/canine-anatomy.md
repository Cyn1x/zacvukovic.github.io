# Canine Anatomy

The purpose of this web app was to revolutionize 3D anatomy exploration in a way that existing solutions could not. Unlike current solutions that would involve long load times when switching between different layers of the dog, our system achieved this in real time.<br /><br />

My role was to rebuild the app in Unity to showcase how a real-time anatomy explorer can greatly enhance the user experience compared to the previously used off-the-shelf 3D explorers, which were not well-suited for anatomical exploration.<br /><br />
