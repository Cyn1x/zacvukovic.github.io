# Canine Anatomy

The purpose of this web app was to innovate 3D anatomy exploration in a way that existing solutions could not. Current solutions would require long load times when changing to various layers of the dog, where this system did that in real time.<br /><br />

My role was to remake the app in Unity to demonstrate how a more realtime anatomy explorer could make for a better user experience as opposed to previously used off-the-shelf 3D explorers which weren't really suited for anatomical exploration.<br /><br />
