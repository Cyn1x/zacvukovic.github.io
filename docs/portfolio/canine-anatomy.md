# Canine Anatomy

The WebGL Anatomy Explorer was developed to revolutionise <strong>3D anatomy exploration</strong> by eliminating the long load times typically associated with switching between different anatomical layers. Unlike conventional solutions, our system achieved this in real time, providing a seamless and interactive learning experience.

## My Role & Contributions

- <strong>Rebuilt the App in Unity WebGL</strong> to demonstrate how real-time rendering enhances usability over traditional off-the-shelf 3D explorers.

- <strong>Optimized Performance</strong> to ensure smooth transitions between anatomical layers without delays.

- <strong>Enhanced User Experience</strong> by creating an interactive, real-time anatomy exploration tool better suited for educational applications.

This project showcased how real-time 3D interactivity can transform anatomical education beyond what existing solutions offer.
