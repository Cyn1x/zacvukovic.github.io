# Animal Anatomy Explorer

Animal Anatomy Explorer is a part of a series of vignette educational virtual reality apps created with Meta to showcase the power of VR in education. The objective of this app is to teach users about animal anatomy using anatomically accurate models of a bison and a canine..<br /><br />

The app was remade from the previous version, which used an old interaction system. We updated it with our new platform, incorporating a new interaction system that greatly improves the user experience and introduces additional features.<br /><br />

I assisted my team in creating the core mechanics of the app and implementing a flow sequence to guide users through the experience until they begin the assessment.<br /><br />

Animal Anatomy Explorer is now available on the [Oculus App Lab](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5232164040232317/).<br /><br />
