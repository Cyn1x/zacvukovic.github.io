# Childcare Safety

<strong>Childcare Safety</strong> is part of a series of <strong>educational VR applications</strong> developed in collaboration with <strong>Meta</strong> to highlight the effectiveness of <strong>virtual reality in education.</strong> This app trains users to <strong>identify and sort hazards</strong> in a childcare environment, enhancing safety awareness through interactive learning.

## My Role & Contributions

- <strong>Led the App Development,</strong> designing and implementing the <strong>flow sequence</strong> that guides users through the experience.

- <strong>Rebuilt the Interaction System,</strong> transitioning from an outdated version to a <strong>modernized platform</strong> with improved user experience and expanded features.

- <strong>Integrated Interactive Elements</strong>, leveraging mechanics from our core platform to create engaging, hands-on learning experiences.

This project demonstrated how <strong>VR can enhance safety training</strong> by offering immersive, scenario-based learning environments.

<strong>Childcare Safety</strong> is available on the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5181967315251271/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oculus App Lab</a>.<br /><br />
