  <h1>Childcare Safety</h1>
    <p>Childcare Safety is a part of a series of vignette educational virtual reality apps created with Meta to showcase the power of VR in education. The purpose of this app is to identify and sort hazards in a childcare environment.<br /><br /></p>
    <p>The app was remade from the previous version, which used an old interaction system, to our updated platform with a new interaction system. This upgrade significantly improved the user experience and introduced new features.<br /><br /></p>
    <p>As the main app developer, my role involved designing and implementing the flow sequence for the experience and incorporating various interactables using the mechanics from our core platform.<br /><br /></p>
    <p>Childcare Safety is available on the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5181967315251271/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oculus App Lab</a>.<br /><br /></p>
