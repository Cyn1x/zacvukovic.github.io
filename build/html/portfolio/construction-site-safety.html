  <h1>Construction Site Safety</h1>
    <p>The Construction Site Safety Working at Heights virtual reality app was a joint initiative by TAFE NSW and icare that highlighted the importance of working safely at heights.<br /><br /></p>
    <p>My role for this project was mainly focused on the backend. With a growing team and no tooling around the development of immersive applications, I led a project that introduced a scalable CI/CD pipeline that automatically built, tested, and deployed Unity projects to VR headsets.<br /><br /></p>
    <p>This application also led to advancements in our core development platform which I have also taken the initiative to help the team continue to scale after the project was completed. Using my previous infrastructure experience, I was able to expand on our user profile systems in Unity and integrate them into our enterprise cloud architecture.<br ><br ></p>
    <p>Construction Site Safety was a <a href="https://good-design.org/projects/tafe-nsw-icare-construction-site-safety-working-heights-program/">2022 Good Design Awards</a> winner.<br /><br /></p>
