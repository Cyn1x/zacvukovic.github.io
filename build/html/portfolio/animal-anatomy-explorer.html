  <h1>Animal Anatomy Explorer</h1>
    <p>Animal Anatomy Explorer is apart of a series of vignette educational virtual reality apps created with Meta to showcase the power of VR in education. The purpose of this app in particular is to teach users about animal anatomy using anatomically accurate models of a bison and canine.<br /><br /></p>
    <p>The app was a remake from the previous version on an old interaction system to our updated platform with a new interaction system, which now had a much more improved user experience and other new features added.<br /><br /></p>
    <p>I assisted my team in creating the core mechanics of the app, and implementing a flow sequence to guide users through the experience up until they begin the assessment.<br /><br /></p>
    <p>Animal Anatomy Explorer is available on the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5232164040232317/">Oculus App Lab</a>.<br /><br /></p>
