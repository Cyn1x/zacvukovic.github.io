  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>I am a currently working as a developer who is responsible for developing 3D &amp; XR applications as well as programmable infrastructure provisioning and maintenance to support these applications. I have a very high interest in Software Engineering and Game Development. I obtained the Bachelor of Computer Science (BCompSc) at the University of New England, Armidale. Previous to this, I worked as an IT Professional in the Information Technology industry before making the change to Software Development to pursue a much more creative and technical path.<br /><br /></p>
    <p>I have enjoyed creating things since I was able to do so, from; computer games, music, and computer networks. All areas of the stack are interesting to me; from web development to systems programming, and the communication in between and beyond.<br /><br /></p>
