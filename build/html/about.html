  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>I am currently working as a developer, responsible for developing 3D &amp; XR applications, as well as programmable infrastructure provisioning and maintenance to support these applications. My passion lies in Software Engineering and Game Development. I earned a Bachelor of Computer Science (BCompSc) from the University of New England, Armidale. Prior to transitioning into Software Development, I worked as an IT Professional in the Information Technology industry. However, I decided to pursue a more creative and technical path..<br /><br /></p>
    <p>Creating things has been a lifelong passion of mine, whether it's computer games, music, or computer networks. I find all areas of the stack intriguing, from web development to systems programming, and the communication that occurs in between and beyond.<br /><br /></p>
