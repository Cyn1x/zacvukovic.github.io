  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>I'm an XR Developer who is responsible for developing state of the art AR/VR applications as well as the systems that surround them. My passion lies in Software Engineering and Game Development. I earned a Bachelor of Computer Science (BCompSc) from the University of New England, Armidale. Prior to transitioning into Software Development, I worked as an IT Professional in the Information Technology industry. However, I decided to pursue a more creative and technical path.<br /><br /></p>
    <p>Driven by a fervor for creation that spans diverse domains, from computer games to game engine programming and computer network infrastructure, I am particularly intrigued by every layer of the tech stack; from web development to systems programming, and the communication that occurs in between and beyond.<br /><br /></p>
    <p>Feel free to check out my <a href="/blog">blog</a>, where you can discover the technologies I'm currently working with and the innovative solutions I'm crafting with them.<br /><br /><br /></p>
